Lock current baseline
Re-run baseline and iron-condor backtest + walk-forward on curated candles.
Compare PnL and robustness using the new *_option_features.csv artifacts.
Add artifact visibility
Extend Streamlit (strategy_results_dashboard.py) to show:
chain quality status coverage
PCR/IV term/skew around entries
trade outcome vs feature snapshot
This makes debugging much faster before changing model logic.
Implement risk-first mitigations (feature-flagged)
Add execution-level guardrails first:
temporary short-vol entry block after large downside day
optional price-shock override / fast VIX shock
Keep them toggled in config so you can A/B compare.
Paper data accumulation phase
Run paper loop daily to build real feature history (FII/PCR/IV-surface behavior in practice).
Use this as the primary source for re-validating suspicious regime windows.
FII strategy decision
Since historical FII backfill is weak, treat FII override as “limited confidence historical, normal in forward paper/live.”
Revisit historical FII ingest only if paper results show it materially changes entry quality.
Promotion pipeline
Define explicit promotion gate:
min trades
max drawdown
stability across fee profiles
feature-quality coverage (chain_quality_status=ok share)
Then use this to decide what moves from backtest -> paper -> live.
If you want, I can turn this into a concrete week-by-week execution checklist with commands.
