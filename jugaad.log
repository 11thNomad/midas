What jugaad-data CAN give you
Historical Option Data (per contract, per day)
Using derivatives_df with instrument_type="OPTIDX":
pythonfrom jugaad_data.nse import derivatives_df
from datetime import date

df = derivatives_df(
    symbol="NIFTY",
    from_date=date(2020,1,1),
    to_date=date(2020,1,30),
    expiry_date=date(2020,1,30),
    instrument_type="OPTIDX",
    option_type="CE",
    strike_price=12000
)
Columns you get back:

DATE, EXPIRY, OPTION TYPE, STRIKE PRICE
OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, LTP, SETTLE PRICE
OPEN INTEREST ✅
CHANGE IN OI ✅
TOTAL TRADED QUANTITY, PREMIUM VALUE

This is EOD per-contract data, pulled directly from NSE's bhavcopy archives.
Live Option Chain
Via NSELive — gives current chain with LTP, OI, etc.
Bhavcopy FO Download
bhavcopy_fo_save() downloads the full F&O bhavcopy CSV for any date — every option contract traded that day across all strikes and expiries. This is the bulk approach.

What it CANNOT give you

Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega) — not in NSE's data, must compute via Black-Scholes
IV — must back-solve from close price
Bid-ask spreads — only close/settle prices
Intraday snapshots — EOD only
Full chain in one call (for historical) — you query strike-by-strike, or use bhavcopy bulk


Practical Strategy for NiftyQuant
The bhavcopy approach is your best friend here. Instead of querying strike-by-strike:
python# Download full F&O bhavcopy for a date
bhavcopy_fo_save(date(2022,1,3), "./data/bhavcopy/")

# Then filter for NIFTY index options only
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("fo03Jan2022bhav.csv")
nifty_opts = df[
    (df['INSTRUMENT'] == 'OPTIDX') & 
    (df['SYMBOL'] == 'NIFTY')
]
# Now you have ALL strikes for that expiry on that day
# including OI and change in OI
Loop this over your date range → you have your full historical option chain database with OI, OHLC, volume per strike per day. Then compute IV and Greeks via Black-Scholes.

Verdict
Yes, jugaad-data gets you what you need for backtesting. The key columns — OI, Change in OI, OHLC, volume per strike — are all there. Pair it with your NSE calendar module and a Black-Scholes Greeks calculator, and this replaces the manual NSE archive downloading you had planned, with a clean Python API instead.
One caveat: the library has 36 open issues and isn't actively maintained. The NSE has been known to change their API responses which breaks these scrapers. Worth testing it first on a few dates before building a large pipeline on top of it.
