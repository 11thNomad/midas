The login flow uses your redirect_url to hand your application the required token. Here is the sequence you need to code:

Start the Login: Redirect your user to the Kite login endpoint, passing your API key and specifying version 3:
https://kite.zerodha.com/connect/login?v=3&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY

The Callback: Once the user successfully logs in, Kite will automatically redirect them back to your registered redirect_url and append a request_token as a query parameter.
Example: https://your_redirect_url.com/?request_token=YOUR_REQUEST_TOKEN

Extract the Token: Your code at the redirect_url endpoint needs to extract this request_token from the URL parameters.

Exchange for Access Token: Immediately take that request_token, combine it with your api_secret, generate a SHA-256 checksum, and make a POST request to /session/token to get your final access_token
