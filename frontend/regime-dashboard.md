Here's your regime analysis dashboard. Let me walk you through what it shows and how to use it for visual validation:
What you're looking at:
The main price chart colors each segment of the NIFTY line by its classified regime — green for low-vol ranging, blue for low-vol trending, amber for high-vol trending, red for high-vol choppy. Below it, the VIX and ADX panel shows the raw signals that drive the classification, with threshold lines at VIX 14/18 and ADX 25 so you can visually verify that the regime labels match the signal values.
How to validate:
Use the year filter buttons to zoom into specific periods. For each period, ask yourself: does the color of the price line match my intuition about what was happening? The Adani crisis period should show red/amber (high vol). The calm mid-2023 summer should be solidly green (low vol ranging). The election volatility in 2024 should flash amber/red.
Toggle FII Flow on — you'll see the red bars during selloff periods, and you can verify that the regime classifier correctly overrides to HIGH_VOL_CHOPPY when FII selling is extreme even if VIX hasn't caught up yet.
Click any regime card at the top to highlight only that regime on the chart. This lets you see, for example, all the LOW_VOL_RANGING periods isolated — are they genuinely flat/range-bound on the price chart? If a green period shows a strong trend, your VIX or ADX thresholds need adjustment.
The regime timeline bar at the bottom gives you a compressed view of how regimes sequence and how long each lasts. Very short bands (1-2 days) suggest the classifier is flip-flopping — you'd want to add hysteresis (require 2 consecutive days before switching).
The VIX × ADX matrix at the bottom shows the actual decision logic visually.
