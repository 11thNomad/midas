Critical Issues Found
1. Strike selection is completely broken (most important)
Look at trade #4 (the -₹1,651 loser):
Call short: NIFTY_20221222_15000CE @ ₹2,746
NIFTY was trading around 18,800 at the time. Selling a 15,000 CE is 3,800 points deep ITM. That's not an iron condor, that's selling deep ITM calls at intrinsic value with zero premium edge.
Trade #5 is even worse:
Put short: NIFTY_20221229_10500PE @ ₹3.05 (with NIFTY ~18,800)
Put hedge: NIFTY_20221229_10500PE @ ₹3.05 (SAME strike as short!)
The put wing width is 0. This isn't a condor at all — it's an uncapped risk position that also duplicated the same strike for both legs.
Trade #9 has the same problem — call short strike 16,000 vs call hedge 16,100 but put short and put hedge are both 16,000 PE. Zero put spread.
Root cause: The delta-based strike selection is failing when delta data is absent and the OTM fallback is selecting nonsensical strikes. The wing_width=100 hedge calculation is also producing degenerate spreads in some cases.

2. The "profit target" trades are fake wins
Trade #10 (the +₹535 "winner"):
Call short: NIFTY_20230406_16050CE @ ₹1,417
Call hedge: NIFTY_20230406_16150CE @ ₹855
NIFTY was ~17,400 at the time. Selling a 16,050 CE deep ITM isn't a short-vol trade. The "profit" here is an artifact of the broken strike selection, not strategy edge.
Trade #15 (+₹543): Similar issue — put short at 19,550 with NIFTY ~18,200 = deep ITM put being sold.
The two profitable trades are not real — they're accounting artifacts of broken leg construction.

3. The unimplemented config gates explain poor entry quality
As noted in the report, these are not enforced:

min_entry_vix / max_entry_vix — entries happening at VIX 11.9 to 13.8, which spans your valid range, so this is less critical
entry_days — entries happening on any day, not just Monday/Tuesday
min_premium — trade #14 entered for ₹1.29 total credit. After ₹188 in fees, this was never going to work
atr_multiple — strikes not being set relative to ATR means no dynamic adjustment to volatility


4. Fee drag is catastrophic at small credit sizes
Most trades collected ₹120–₹390 in credit but paid ₹190 in fees (entry + exit combined). You need a minimum of ~₹400 credit just to break even on costs. The min_premium: 15 config gate would help but it's not enforced, and ₹15/unit × 50 lots = ₹750 minimum credit is what you actually need.

5. Hold duration mismatch
Trades #5, #9, #13 show holds of 38, 11, and 6 days respectively. Your strategy spec says enter Monday, exit Wednesday. But dte_exit=1 means the code holds until 1 day before expiry — not Wednesday of entry week. The Wednesday 3 PM hard exit rule from the KB is not implemented.

6. The 27 unmatched exit timestamps
This is a data integrity flag. 45 exit events for 18 entries means ~1.5 exit events per trade on average. Likely caused by partial leg exits being logged separately, or leg-level exits vs position-level exits being double-counted. This means per-trade P&L figures may have allocation errors. The summary-level metrics (total return, fees) are probably more reliable than individual trade P&L.

What To Fix Before Next Backtest
Priority 1 — Strike construction:

Add assertion: short strike must be OTM (call short > spot, put short < spot)
Add assertion: wing strikes must be further OTM than short strikes
Add assertion: entry credit gross > 0 (negative credit = broken construction)
Log and skip any trade where these fail — don't silently enter broken positions

Priority 2 — Implement the missing config gates:

entry_days: [Monday, Tuesday]
min_premium: 15 (per unit, so ₹750 minimum credit at 50 lots)
max_entry_vix: 16, min_entry_vix: 9
Wednesday 3 PM hard time exit (not DTE=1)

Priority 3 — Fix the DTE exit:

dte_exit=1 holds too long. Change to calendar-day Wednesday exit or DTE ≥ 2

Priority 4 — Fix the fill/exit logging:

Resolve the 27 unmatched exits before using per-trade analytics


One Positive Signal
The regime classifier integration is working — trade #3 (2023-03-02) correctly exited on regime change from low_vol_ranging to high_vol_choppy, and trade #4 (2022-12-20) correctly exited on regime change to high_vol_choppy. The regime exit gate functions as designed. That's the one piece of infrastructure that's working correctly.

Bottom Line
Run the assertions first, fix strike selection, implement the missing config gates, then re-run. The current results are not a verdict on iron condor viability — they're a verdict on the current implementation quality. The strategy hasn't been tested yet.

Phase 1: Hard Stop Validations (Fixing the Generative Bugs)
Your system is currently flying blind when primary data (like delta) drops out. You must implement strict, unbypassable assertions before any order is sent to the simulator.

Moneyness Enforcement: Call_Short_Strike > Spot_Price AND Put_Short_Strike < Spot_Price. If this evaluates to False, drop the trade entirely.

Wing Width Enforcement: Call_Long_Strike > Call_Short_Strike AND Put_Long_Strike < Put_Short_Strike. Width must strictly equal your intended underlying point distance.

Credit Validation: Total_Premium_Collected > Minimum_Viable_Credit. Never open an Iron Condor for a debit or a microscopic credit.

Phase 2: State Management & Accounting (Fixing the P&L)
The 27 unmatched exits and the 14 fills per trade indicate your loop is severely broken.

Audit the Exit Loop: Your engine is either double-logging partial fills or failing to close out the trade_active state flag once a leg is closed, causing it to trigger exit orders on already-closed positions.

Fix Fee Assumptions: A strategy generating ₹120 in credit while bleeding ₹190 in fees is dead on arrival. Enforce your min_premium config at the portfolio sizing level (e.g., the ₹750 minimum you identified) before entry.

Phase 3: Logic & Time Gates (Enforcing the Rules)
Once the engine can reliably open a valid Iron Condor and accurately log its exit, enforce your actual strategy parameters.

Temporal Constraints: Implement the Monday/Tuesday entry and the Wednesday 3:00 PM hard exit. Relying on dte_exit=1 delegates your exit timing to the exchange's calendar logic rather than your strategy's intent.

Volatility Constraints: Wire up the min_entry_vix and max_entry_vix parameters to prevent the system from selling premium in barren, low-volatility environments where the fee-to-credit ratio is inverted.
